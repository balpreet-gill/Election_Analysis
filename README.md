# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
    ### The purpose of this election audit analysis
    - After going through the modules I was able to help Seth and Tom submit their election audit results to the election comission. After that the election commision also needs a little more information i.e. the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of total count and the county with the higest turnout. 

## Election-Audit Results
    - 369,711 votes were casted in this congressional election.
    - County votes for Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe are 38,855: 306,055: 24,801 respectively. 
    - The largest county turnover was Denver with a percentage win of 82.8%. 
    - Out of all the candidates Diana DeGette won the election by 73.8% votes i.e. 272,892 votes, Charles Casper Stokham was second in place with 23.0% votes i.e. 85,213 votes, and Raymon Anthony Doane was third in place with just a 3.1% votes i.e. 11,606 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary
 For future use of this script for election a few changes can be made to the script to get the updated outcome of election. 
### Two ways by which this script can be modified to produce the results for any election
    - Make sure that the comma separated value file is uploaded and used as the csv file in script. 
    - The titles in the written analysis can be modified by simply erasing the previous ones and changing to new ones. For example, to change "Election results" to "Election results 2023" click on the "Election results" inside the "f string" text and change it to the latter. Similarly other titles and variables can be modified to something that makes the analysis easier to read for the reader.
